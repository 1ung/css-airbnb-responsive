# Airbnb Mockup - Responsive Edition!

Remember Airbnb's webpage?

This time, we'll build a "mobile-first" version of our Airbnb mockup.

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your computer
* The starter code in this repo is a mobile-first version of the original css-airbnb exercise

## Requirements
* The deliverable screenshot is of a desktop version of the website.
* Use media queries to make the webpage appear like the screenshot on desktop clients.
* Think about the minimal number of steps you need to achieve this:
  * Which specific CSS declarations need to be changed when viewed on a desktop?
  * What additional HTML elements might you need to add?

## Deliverable

Here's a screenshot of the portion that should be replicated. Deliver the mockup as close as possible. In addition, code should be well-indented and follow best practices, including no linter errors.
